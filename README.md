# My Personal Best Practices for Angular (as of 2023)

## What is included?
- [x] All standalone
- [x] All with control flow
- [x] No RxJS: All signals and promises
- [x] Fake backend with easy to debug API
- [x] No external dependencies
- [x] As much lazy loading and deference of content loading as possible
- [x] Routing with guards
- [x] Auxiliary routing for modals
- [x] SVG icon colorization per SASS
- [x] Self-collapsing sidebar with expansion animation
- [x] Dashboard with configurable widgets (manually per fake API)
- [x] NO FLUFF!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
